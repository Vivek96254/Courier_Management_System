Project Description:
Courier management system is a software application designed for courier companies to manage their courier's data efficiently. The system allows authorized users to insert, delete, search, update and sort courier data as per the requirement. The system provides a secure login mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access the data. The system also generates various reports to help the management make informed decisions about the courier operations.

Modules:

Insert Module:
The insert module allows authorized users to add new courier data to the system. The user inputs the courier's name, address, phone number, and email address, and the system stores it in the database. The insert module checks for the validity of the data entered by the user and generates an error message if the data is invalid.

Display Module:
The display module allows authorized users to view the courier data stored in the system. The user can view the data in a tabular format or as a list. The display module also allows the user to filter the data based on different criteria such as courier name, date of delivery, and courier type.

Search Module:
The search module allows authorized users to search for courier data based on specific criteria. The user can search for a courier's data using the courier's name, phone number, email address, or address. The search module returns the matching courier data from the system.

Delete/Update Module:
The delete/update module allows authorized users to delete or update existing courier data in the system. The user can select the courier data to delete or update and then enter the new values for the data to be updated. The module verifies the validity of the data entered by the user before updating the data.

Sort Module:
The sort module allows authorized users to sort the courier data based on specific criteria. The user can sort the data based on courier name, delivery date, or courier type. The sort module uses various sorting algorithms to sort the data efficiently.
